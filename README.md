# Unit-8 - Classes and Objects

This unit will cover the concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concurrently with students working on their independent projects since any worthwhile, advanced project in Python will require knowledge of OOP.

We will start with our class in the same file as our main, but we will talk about keeping our code in other files, called modules, and how to import those. This is covered in the namespaces lesson in CodeHS but we will start this early in the unit
